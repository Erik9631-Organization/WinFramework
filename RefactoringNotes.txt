#CoreWindow
vector<reference_wrapper<Component>> components // Reference to component should be held by the Window
CreateConsole // Move to somehwere more appropriate
void AssignGraphicsToComponents() //Move to Window, this is HIGH level stuff. 
ComponentAdded() // Should be a subscriber to the Window which is a source---Observer pattern
WindowsMessageLoop() // Should be handled internally by the CoreWindow and should start on its own. No external call should be required
ProcessMessage() Should be handled in its own class via observer visitor pattern
ConsoleWrite() Should be moved to a utility class


#Window
CoreWindow* coreFrame; // Should be a reference as CoreWindow is part of windowFrame
UpdateWindow // Should be renamed to Update and should be part of the Component class



#General refactoring notes
rename CoreWindow to CoreWindow
rename Window to Window
rename Pane to Panel
Graphics in components should use the decorator pattern. They should have a unified interface. Graphic components can be added to other components to generate a bigger piece
